regex for JSON {...}
escapes "{"
escapes "\"{"
(?'bracket'\{((?>(?:"(?:\\.|.)*?"|[^{}])+|(?P>bracket))*)\})(.*)$


first write it recursive
then write it linear, it's the same logic to be true

the first thing you see is : [ or {
so the FIRST thing you do is branch out
if branch out, then so be it,
the value branch out stage: I'll branch out [, {, ", \d, t|f, n

objects, arrays, numbers, strings, booleans, and null

trailing commas are forbidden.
we need to support trailing comma or else it's gonna break for vscode settings.json

we like to cheat, we like to cheat, use regex, use regex
shame on those who say regex is bad, regex is beauty

I have met regex recursion, PCRE2 conditional replace,
